Abstract: For over three decades, the United States federal government has provided assistance to commercial, recreational, and indigenous fishing communities following the disastrous consequences of mismanagement or extreme environmental events. While these Federal Fisheries Disasters have resulted in billions of U.S. dollars of Congressional allocations and revenue loss, the declaration process is largely ad hoc and lacks the detail sufficient to properly assess allocation fairness and benefit. Nonetheless, the frequency of fishery disaster declarations has increased over time and disaster causes have shifted from anthropogenic (e.g. mis-management) to extreme environmental events (e.g. marine heatwaves). As climate change drives higher rates of such extreme events, the federal system for fisheries disaster declaration and mitigation must evolve in order to effectively protect fishing communities and their societal benefit.
