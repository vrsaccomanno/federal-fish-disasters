```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
#Attach packages

library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(packHV)
library(boot)
library(naniar)

```


```{r}
#Load data
econ_raw <- read_csv("econ_est_R_2.csv")
View(econ_raw)

```

### 1. Data wrangling and exploration
```{r}
# Exploratory graph
ggplot(econ_raw, aes(x = dollar_diff_real)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 5) +
  theme_light()
#Non-normal distribution

#Q-Q plots
qqnorm(econ_raw$dollar_diff_real)
#Curving off at the extremities = data have more extreme values that we'd expect if they truly came from a normal distribution

#Test for normality
shapiro.test(econ_raw$dollar_diff_real)
#p-value = 1.167e-10 = statisticlly different from a normal distribution


# Pull revenue change (real) as a vector (removes the 8 NAs)
econ_change <- econ_raw%>% 
  pull(dollar_diff_real)%>%
  na.omit

View(econ_change)
summary(econ_change)
#      Min.    1st Qu.     Median       Mean    3rd Qu.       Max. 
# -139911239     421652    4402333   37558907   21272846  300618829 
sum(econ_change) #2,816,918,041

```

###2. Use the set.seed function to ensure all results, figures, etc are reproducible.
```{r}
set.seed(123)
```


###3. Create a function for bootstrapping analysis:

```{r}

#### Create a function to calculate the MEAN of varying vectors (x) of index (i)

mean_fun <- function (x,i) {mean(x[i])}

# 100000 bootstrap samples:
#set.seed(12345)
boot_mean_100000 <- boot(econ_change, mean_fun, R = 100000)

ggplot() +
  aes(boot_mean_100000$t) +
  geom_histogram()

boot_mean_100000$t0 # to report the mean of the original sample =$37,558,907
boot_mean_100000 # to report bias, SE
#Bias (difference between original sample mean and bootstrapped sampling mean)= $-21,095.02
#Std. error (SD of bootstrapped sampling distribution)=$9,769,385


################

#### Create a function to calculate the MEDIAN of varying vectors (x) of index (i)
median_fun <- function (x,i) {median(x[i])}

# 100000 bootstrap samples:
#set.seed(12345)
boot_med_100000 <- boot(econ_change, median_fun, R = 100000)

ggplot() +
  aes(boot_med_100000$t) +
  geom_histogram()

boot_med_100000$t0 # Median of the original sample =$4,402,333
boot_med_100000 # to report bias, SE
#Bias (difference between original sample median and bootstrapped sampling median)=$664,443.9
#Std. error (SD of bootstrapped sampling distribution)= $3,072,013

```


###4. Find a bootstrapped confidence interval:

```{r}
#95% CI for mean statistic
boot.ci(boot_mean_100000, conf = 0.95, type = 'basic') #'basic' = compute differences between each bootstrap replication and t0 and use percentiles of their distribution. 

#Intervals : 
#Level      Basic         
#95%   (17549009, 55799905 )  

# Mean, direct revenue loss in a disaster year is $37,558,907 ($US2019) (n=78), with a boot strapped 95% confidence interval of [$17,549,009, $55,799,905] (n= 100,000 bootstrap samples).

#######################

#95% CI for median statistic, 100,000
boot.ci(boot_med_100000, conf = 0.95, type = 'basic') #'basic' = compute differences between each bootstrap replication and t0 and use percentiles of their distribution. 

#Intervals : 
#Level      Basic         
#95%   (-3562980,  7117533 ) 

# Median, direct revenue loss in a disaster year is $4,402,333($US2019) (n=78), with a boot strapped 95% confidence interval of [-$3562980,  7117533 )] (n= 100,000 bootstrap samples).
  
```


###5. Other summary statistics

```{r}
#Assess the appropriation amount to revenue loss ratio
appropiation_ratio <- econ_impute %>%
  mutate(app_ratio = appropration_amt/dollar_diff_real)%>%
  drop_na(app_ratio)

count(appropiation_ratio, app_ratio >1)
count(appropiation_ratio, app_ratio <0)
#23 are greater than 1
#31 are less than 1
#16 are negative

mean(appropiation_ratio$app_ratio)
#52.09476
median(appropiation_ratio$app_ratio)
#0.4620938

```
